                    <p>Once Prohibition was enacted in 1920, to make and sell intoxicating alcohol was illegal. In spite of that,  more people than ever drank. Speakeasies, or illegal bars, popped up in the back rooms and basements of legitimate businesses. Some of these clandestine bars instead used fake fronts that looked like shops but were just set up to conceal their real purpose. In New York City there were an estimated 30,000 speakeasies!
                    </p>
                    <p>Speakeasy doors were often guarded and only people who knew the password were admitted. "Speakeasy" may refer to the need for a password, or the need to speak quietly while drinking to avoid attracting attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>Speakeasy customers risked ending their night out in jail, so being able to dodge the authorities was important. The Back Room started behind Ratner's, a legitimate kosher restaurant on the Lower East Side. Because the back room was situated where three different buildings met, there were multiple exits onto three different streets. This made it an attractive meeting place for gangsters including Meyer Lansky and Bugsy Siegel.  
                    </p>     
                    <p>Owners went to great lengths to hide their liquor. The 21 Club opened in 1930 in midtown Manhattan and had built-in features to help it survive police raids. The wine cellar was in the basement of an adjacent building, accessed by a camouflaged door, so authorities couldn't find wine on the premises they were searching. A system of levers tipped the bar shelves so that the liquor bottles fell down chutes that led to the city sewers. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Chumley's in the West Village was a blacksmith's shop turned into speakeasy. It had two unmarked doors, one leading deceptively to a courtyard. It also had trapdoors and secret stairs used to hide any evidence. Of course, corruption was part of the game and the cops would call ahead to tell the bartender which door to send the customers out of.

                       Harry Craddock, an American bartender in London during Prohibition, compiled the <em>Savoy Cocktail Handbook</em>. He said of the Corpse Reviver that "four of these taken in quick succession will un-revive the corpse." As this was drink was considered a hangover cure, hopefully one didn't need four.

                       This is the drink most associated with Prohition, in spite of highlighting French alcohol that took extra effort to obtain. Competing origin stories involve motorcycle sidecars in Paris or the liquor leftovers in New Orleans bars. Recipes vary, but each produces a delicious drink.

                       In spite of the girlish name and colors, this packs a punch. With the egg white, it was not an everyday beverage at local "blind pigs" - holes-in-the-wall that sold tickets to nonexistent curiosities and "gave away" beverages. But it was already a favorite before Prohibition and continued to be popular because it disguised the flavor of indifferent gin.
                    </p>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>1/2 oz gin</li>
                            <li>1/2 oz applejack or brandy</li>
                            <li>3/4 oz fresh lemon juice</li>
                            <li>4 dashes grenadine or raspberry syrup</li>
                            <li>1 egg white (use half)</li>
                            <li>maraschino cherry for garnish</li>           
                        </ul>
                   
                        <p>Combine ingredients in a room-temperature shaker without ice and shake very hard to emulsify the egg white and create a foam. Fill shaker with ice and shake again, then strain into a chilled glass. Garnish.
