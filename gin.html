                    <p>Many Prohibition-era cocktails were made with gin because it could be made quickly almost anywhere. It also tended to be undrinkable, so mixing it with ingredients that disguised its harshness and horrid flavor was key. 
                    </p>
                    <p>"Bathtub gin" describes the low-quality homemade gin of that time. 
                    Because alcohol production was illegal, it was an unregulated business and there were no standards for safety, cleanliness, or quality. </p>
                    <p>The usual gin bottles were too tall to be filled at kitchen taps, so bathtub taps were used. 
                    Also bathtubs were small enough containers to remain undetected by law enforcement. 
                    This gin was not distilled; it was a gin-like mixture of cheap grain or wood alcohol, water, glycerin, and flavoring such as juniper 
                    that was steeped for a few hours or days.  
                    </p>     
                    <p>People making gin were often amateurs and sometimes used alcohol that was not processed for human consumption. Partygoers of the 1920s sometimes died from contaminated liquor.</p>

                       Highballs were a simple way to cover up poor-quality liquor, being just one kind of alcohol mixed with soda. The rickey had been made with bourbon before Prohibition, but gin's availability changed the recipe. Gin rickeys were a favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald and are mentioned by name in <em>The Great Gatsby</em>.

                       This was the house drink at the famous 21 Club, formerly a speakeasy and still in business in Manhattan. Some say this was a favorite of Al Capone and his gang, and the name could refer to his district in Chicago. Or it might have been created at the Southside Sportsmen's Club of Long Island.
