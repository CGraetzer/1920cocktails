                    <p>Rum running was the maritime version of bootlegging. Rum was in demand, and captains loaded their yachts and ships to bring vast quantities from Cuba and the Bahamas to Florida and up the east coast. Soon they were shipping whiskey and other liquor from Canada through the Great Lakes and down the west coast as well. 
                    </p>
                    <p>At the beginning of Prohibition, the ban extended three miles off shore. In 1924 the limit was increased to 12 miles. Ships stopped there and waited for local men with small speedboats willing to take the risk of delivering the contraband to shore. Off of major urban centers the ships even formed "rum rows," lines of ships waiting to unload, with up to 60 ships at a time. They flew flags to advertise parties and attract customers.</p>
                    <p>The Coast Guard patrolled the waters inside the limit and intercepted the smaller boats, but Coast Guard cutters were often spread too thin and had other work to do. In addition, smugglers souped up their engines and ran in foggy and risky conditions in order to dart into remote shallows, drop off crates for truckers, and speed away.

                       The name of this drink jokingly commemorates the increased distance that the law imposed to keep partying scofflaws out of sight of shore.

                       This fruity drink is attributed to Eddie Woelke, a New York bartender who went to  Havana during Prohibition. It honors "America's sweetheart," Mary Pickford, a top silent film star, Hollywood producer, and co-founder of United Artists.
