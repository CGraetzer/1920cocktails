                    <p>Making moonshine, or illicit distilled spirits, had been a way for desperate farmers, especially in Appalachia and the South, to turn their corn into money and avoid taxes. Moonshiners had stills hidden away and used them only at night to avoid being caught by authorities. They used fermented corn mash to make alcohol and then distilled the alcohol to create un-aged, very potent whiskey.  
                    </p>
                    <p>During Prohibition, production shot up. This made for more dangerous spirits as moonshiners cut corners in the distillation process, used poisonous additives to give the whiskey more kick, or used car radiators in their stills. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Bootleggers were the smugglers who transported and sold the whiskey to speakeasies and nightclubs. In the decades after Prohibition, their use of souped-up car engines to outrace revenuers, or tax collectors, led to the development of NASCAR. Meanwhile during the 1920s, managing the supply and distribution of liquor led to the growth of organized gangs. These gangs eventually worked together and entered other rackets after Prohibition, becoming America's organized crime.

                       The whiskey sour predated and survived Prohibition, unlike quite a few other cocktail recipes. The idea of a sour might have started in the 1700s with sailors who mixed lemon with their alcohol, to prevent scurvy while drinking something safer than water. On land in the U.S., whiskey was favored. Sometimes people add an egg white.

                       This might have been named after the ward that gave a Bostonian politician his winning margin in 1989. Ironically the politician, Martin Lomasny, was a Prohibitionist. At any rate the drink worked well during Prohibition because it disguised the taste of the liquor, leading one reviewer to write that "this drink lies like a politician."
